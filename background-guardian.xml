        <description>
            <p>You were trained and provisioned to be a guardian to a special place. Whether you were brought up in a family that has always been guardians, or decided to become one out of choice, you are a staunch defender and warrior. Perhaps you guard a temple or sacred site from those who wish to take it. Or, you could have been a member of a royal guard or protected a city from invaders.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you choose this background, work with your DM to determine what kind of organization you were a part of, how your training was, and what kind of place you swore to protect. Was it an ancient temple dedicated to the gods? Or was it a city which you loved dearly, and would give your life to protect?</p>
            <ul class="unstyled">
                <li><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Intimidation, Perception</li>
                <li><strong>Languages:</strong> Two of your choice</li>
                <li><strong>Equipment:</strong> A set of common clothes, a set of medium armor, a simple or martial weapon of your choice, a banner, a ring of keys that go to where you are stationed, and a pouch containing 10 gp</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</h5>
            <p>For those who are guardians, the law and upholding of vows and honor are important, regardless of what, where, or whom you serve. Thus, guardians tend to be those with a firm understanding and respect for rules and structure, while also being people who are strong and brave.</p>
