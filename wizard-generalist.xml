        <description>
            <p>While many wizards focus on mastering a particular school of magic, there are a handful of wizards who want to master as much of the arcane arts as they can. These wizards, often called ‘generalists’, focus on acquiring spells and learning as much as they can regarding the arcane. These wizards learn how to eventually change their prepared spells, cast more spells, and increase their focus with spellcasting.</p>
