            <p>Tidecallers are a rare kind of wizard, bravely exploring the vast seas of the world to learn about the magical wonders that lie beneath the waves. They are wizards who master techniques of sailing and maneuvering in water, wielding weapons of the sea, and draw strength from the cold depths of the oceans. Followers of this tradition are usually, found out near or on the seas, aiding ships in smooth sailing and helping to explore uncharted territories, often singing. It is not uncommon to see these wizards befriend some druids or storm sorcerers, or even see Tidecallers commanding ships or fleets themselves.</p>
