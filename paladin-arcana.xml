        <supports>Sacred Oath</supports>
        <description>
            <p>The Oath of Arcana is as ancient as magic itself, though rare to hell found. The few paladins who swear this oath are sometimes referred to as Battlemages, Magic Knights, or Esotericists. These paladins believe that while magic is a powerful and helpful tool, it can also be used for dangerous reasons, and thus these warriors uphold the belief that a balance must be kept in order to maintain order. Some follow gods such as Mystra, while others train and study with wizards to better learn the ways of the arcane arts. Their armor is often adorned with arcane sigils and symbols, and some who adhere to this oath adopt the symbols of wizards.</p>
            <h5>TENETS OF ARCANA</h5>
            <p>The tenets of the Oath of Arcana emphasize the understanding of magic, as well as the seeking out of those who would abuse its power.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Understanding.</em></strong> Strive to learn as much as possible about magic, so as to have an understanding of its many forms.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Wielding.</em></strong> Train and practice to perfect the art of wielding magic for yourself, to attune yourself to its power and to know its limits.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Seeking.</em></strong> You have a duty to find those who would abuse the power of magic, and would cause chaos with its capabilities.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Balance.</em></strong> Above all, remember that magic, like many forces in the universe, has a balance, and it is through this balance that order and peace can thrive.</p>
