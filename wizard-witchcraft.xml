        <description>
            <p>Before the times of prestigious magical institutions and universities, there were those who first discovered the arts of the arcane, in its raw and primal form. These wizards were the herald for a magical tradition known as Witchcraft. The wizards and witches who follow this tradition hone their magical skills through the acquisition of unique magics called Crafts, and later Grand Crafts, as well as learning spells the usual wizard would not be able to. Many who study the tradition of Witchcraft can be seen as either guides and village elders, or as sinister and dark practitioners of the arcane. However, while some places may be more accepting to students of witchcraft, other established universities or regions may have a much more demeaning view of these magical practitioners, even going so far as to hunt them down.</p>

        <description>
            <p>Beginning at 2nd level, you enter into a Coven, which helps to define what special field of witchcraft you adhere to. Your Coven grants you special abilities, one of which is the acquisition of many spells normally not known to the wizards who follow other magical traditions. Choose one of the following Covens:</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Black Magic.</em></strong> (focuses on curses, toying with the minds of others, and the dead). <strong>Bard &amp; Warlock</strong> - enchantment, evocation, necromancy</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Green Magic.</em></strong> (focuses on aspects of nature, such as the elements, animals, and plantlife). <strong>Druid</strong> - conjuration, divination, transmutation</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>White Magic.</em></strong> (focuses on healing, medicine, and divine or heavenly qualities of both life and the world). <strong>Cleric</strong> - abjuration, divination, transmutation</p>
            <p class="indent">You learn one cantrip of your choice from a Class associated with your Coven. Whenever you gain a wizard level, you can replace one of the wizard spells you add to your spellbook with a spell from your Coven’s associated class, so long as it belongs to the schools associated with that coven. These spells are known as your Coven spells. The spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots. Any Coven spell you gain from this feature is considered a wizard spell for you, and you can cast them using a wizard spell slot, but other wizards can’t copy Coven spells from your Grimoire into their own spellbooks, and any wizard feature that utilizes a spellbook does not utilize an Arcane Grimoire.</p>
