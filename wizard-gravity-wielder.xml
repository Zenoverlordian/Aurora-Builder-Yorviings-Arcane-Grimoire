            <p>The rare tradition of Gravity Wielding is one where wizards explore the universal forces of gravity, focusing on spells andmagic that help to manipulate the cosmic forces that hold and move objects and people. Wizards who study this tradition are hard to find, yet when they are encountered, they are usually found either in astronomies, or traversing the planes in order to master their control over all objects within existence.</p>

            <p>Starting at 2nd level, the power of gravity has become yours to control. You learn the mage hand cantrip if you do not already know it, and it does not count towards the total number of cantrips that you know. When you cast mage hand, you can choose to have the hand become invisible, and the maximum it can lift, push, or pull is an amount of weight equal to 10 times your Intelligence modifier in pounds. This amount increases to 20 times your Intelligence modifier in pounds at 10th level.</p>

            <p>Beginning at 2nd level, you have learned how to manipulate the gravitational forces around others. When a creature misses you or an ally within 5 feet of your mage hand with an attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to make a Constitution saving throw against your wizard spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature is either pushed or pulled from you or your ally's location or your mage hand’s location (your choice) by 10 feet. This increases by an additional 10 feet at 6th level (20 feet), 10th level (30 feet), and 14th level (40 feet).</p>

            <p>By 6th level, you have learned to attune your body to gravity. Whenever you fall, you can use your reaction to cast either feather fall or levitate on yourself without expending a wizard spell slot. You can do this a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier per long rest.</p>

If you already know the spell reverse gravity, then you may choose another spell of 7th level or lower on the wizard spell list.
