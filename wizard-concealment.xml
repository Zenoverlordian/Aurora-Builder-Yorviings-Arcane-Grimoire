        <description>
            <p>Followers of the tradition of Concealment are wizards who specialize in not being seen, practicing magic in secret places and focusing on hiding their spellcasting from others. These wizards, often called ‘stealth mages’ or ‘silent sages’, combine elements of illusion and transmutation magic with a skill set of stealth and maneuverability, and often work as spies, assassins, or undercover operatives.</p>

        <description>
            <p>By 10th level, your skills with concealing your presence while casting spells have increased. Casting a spell while hidden doesn't reveal your position.</p>
            <p class="indent">Additionally, whenever you cast a spell with a casting time of one action while hidden, as part of the casting of the spell, you can cause the spell to appear invisible. If the spell requires an attack roll, you gain advantage on the roll. If the spell requires a target to make a saving throw, the target makes the saving throw at disadvantage.</p>
